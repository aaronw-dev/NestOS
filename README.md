# What is NestOS? 
NestOS is my all-in-one comprehensive solution to UAV control and management for all of my projects. With this app, one can remotely control a vehicle, view vehicle telemetry, and see a live camera feed from the vehicle itself.

This software is inspired by the 
<a href="https://www.anduril.com/command-and-control/">Lattice</a> 
software built by 
<a href="https://anduril.com">Anduril Industries</a>. It uses an external microcontroller and radio system to pull vehicle telemetry and other data through a USB serial connection. In the future, this application will be rendered on an SBC such as the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 for maximum ease of portability in the field. This will also mean that we can run NestOS for longer due to lower power consumption.
